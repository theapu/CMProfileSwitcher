<h3>Usage</h3>
<b>Note - this will only work on phones that have ProfileManager and the CyanogenMod SDK.
    (CM12.1+)</b>

<p>
    Create schedules for when you want your phone to automatically change profiles. To create a
    schedule,
    chose "New schedule" in the menu. Choose the profile you want to switch, the time of day (24
    hour
    clock) and which days of the week.
    <br>
    For example: Imagine you have profiles Work, Home and Night. You could have the following
    schedules.
<ul>
    <li>Work @ 08:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday
    <li>Home @ 10:30 on Saturday & Sunday
    <li>Home @ 17:30 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday
    <li>Night @ 23:30 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday & Sunday
</ul>

<p>You can also set timed profiles - similar to the old Nokias :-) for once off occasions. e.g Going
    to the cinema. Choose "Timed Profile", pick profile Silent for 2 hours.

<b>Headset plug/unplug reset option.</b>
<br>Standard behaviour in Android is that plugging in a headset causes the volume
settings etc. to switch to what they were the
last time a headset was plugged in. Likewise for unplugging a headset.
If you change a profile (either manually or using this app) and then plug/unplug a
headset, the volume settings will be changed (but the active profile will remain the same)
<br>
This is reason you may want to have the profile reset after a headset is plugged/unplugged.

<p>
    <b>Timed profile.</b>
    <br>
    At the end of a timed profile, it will revert to the profile that was active before the
    timed profile was created. If a scheduled profile change was supposed to happen, before the
    time profile has finished, it will revert to this profile.

<p>

<b>Errata</b>
<ul>
    <li>Toast are sent every time a profile changes (there is no option to turn this off)
    <li>There is quite a bit of logging happening (this is still an alpha)
</ul>
